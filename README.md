# PPS Lab Helper (SPPU)
PPS Practical Lab & Mini Project Helper for SPPU Students & Python beginners by chris._.sin

## Description
This app is mainly targeted towards SPPU students who have opted for PPS (Programming and Problem Solving) course and it might also prove useful to Python learners who have just started learning !

Technically, this app can be considered as Lab manual for PPS Lab. It contains Index for all Labs and Mini Projects along with solution code & output. Copy functionality is present as well for copying the code and running it elsewhere, either on Phone or Computer Python interpreters.

Hope this helps in your long endeavor on the path of becoming an Engineer...
Never lose hope, keep moving forwards and I promise you, it'll be alright in the end :D
